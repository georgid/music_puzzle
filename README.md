# tune puzzle

Tune puzzle is a game that helps users effortlessly increase their understanding of their favourite music. Tune puzzle suggests tunes from their favourite artists and creates a puzzle out of them.  Each puzzle piece is a short segment of the song (up to 7 seconds). Users can listen to each segment and need to arrange the segments into correct playing order.
