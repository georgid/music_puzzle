-----------------



- when the puzzle order is correct, the ‘proceed to next level’ message should appear in the bottom, not as pop up! 


- add frame around puzzle area 

- make sure the correct order is not allowed as initial puzzle order

- when the user touches a piece, playback of puzzle should stop (WORKING ON…)

- play original should play original (not correct order)


- There should be indication of beats: either vertical lines blinking or metronome-like sound 

- let the user select: 
  - which musical aspect she likes: the instrument
  - which song was most fun to play  
Then change the recommendation based on that

recommend based on similarity of a pattern example
